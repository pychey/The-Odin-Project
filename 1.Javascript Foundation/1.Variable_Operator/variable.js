//these code supposed to be written in console of website

console.log("hello world");
//let for re-assign
let age=11;
console.log(age);
//const for no re-assign
const pi=3.14;
//pi=10; will throw an error 
console.log(pi);
//var is an old way to declare variable, var is similar to let but it has some quirks, not used anymore
var name="pychey";
console.log(name);
//naming special symbol is valid 
let $ = 5;
console.log($);
//naming invalid if start with number or use - like name-variable
